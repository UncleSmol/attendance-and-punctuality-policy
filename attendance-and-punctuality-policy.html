			<!--Scope Of The Policy-->
			<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>
				This policy establishes guidelines for attendance and punctuality to
				maintain a productive, reliable, and professional environment.
				Consistent attendance and punctuality are essential for Villa Roma
				Hotelâ€™s service standards and contribute to a seamless guest experience
				and effective training for students.
			</p>

			<!--Scope of the Policy-->
			<h2>Scope</h2>
			<p>
				This policy applies to all Villa Roma Hotel employees, including
				permanent staff, temporary staff, and trainees from Nkangala TVET
				College.
			</p>

			<!--Section-Breaker-->
			<div class="section-breaker"></div>
			<h2>Policy Guidelines</h2>
			<h3>1. Attendance Expectations</h3>
			<ul class="ul-list" id="attendance-expectations">
				<li>
					<strong>Regular Attendance:</strong> All employees and trainees are
					expected to attend their scheduled shifts or training sessions
					consistently and fulfill all work or training responsibilities.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Shift Adherence:</strong> Team members should work their
					entire scheduled shifts. Leaving early or arriving late without prior
					approval from a supervisor is discouraged.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Absenteeism:</strong> Absenteeism disrupts operations and
					impacts team morale. Employees are expected to keep unplanned absences
					to a minimum.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>2. Punctuality Standards</h3>
			<ul class="ul-list" id="punctuality-standards">
				<li>
					<strong>Start of Shift:</strong> Employees and trainees must be at
					their assigned workstations and ready to begin work by the start of
					their scheduled shift.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Breaks and Meals:</strong> Follow designated break and meal
					times and return to work promptly. Extending breaks without permission
					is considered a punctuality issue.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Late Arrivals:</strong> Frequent tardiness is disruptive and
					will be monitored. Three or more instances of lateness within a month
					may result in corrective action.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>3. Reporting Absences and Lateness</h3>
			<ul class="ul-list" id="reporting-absences">
				<li>
					<strong>Notification Requirement:</strong> Employees or trainees who
					cannot attend a shift or expect to be late must inform their
					supervisor at least 2 hours before the start of their shift or as soon
					as possible for unforeseen situations.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Acceptable Notification Methods:</strong> Notifications should
					be given via approved communication channels (e.g., phone call, text,
					or email) to a supervisor or designated contact.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Documentation for Absences:</strong> Medical certification may
					be required for absences of two or more consecutive days due to
					illness. Additional documentation may be required for other types of
					leave.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</article>
		<article class="page" id="page-2">
			<h3>4. Types of Absences</h3>
			<ul class="ul-list" id="types-absences">
				<li>
					<strong>Planned Leave:</strong> This includes vacation leave, family
					leave, and other pre-approved absences. Employees and trainees are
					expected to request planned leave at least 14 days in advance for
					proper scheduling.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Sick Leave:</strong> Employees and trainees should notify
					their supervisor as early as possible if sick. Medical documentation
					may be required after multiple days of absence.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Unplanned Absences:</strong> Unforeseen emergencies or issues
					should be communicated promptly. Excessive unplanned absences may
					result in corrective action.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>5. Consequences of Non-Compliance</h3>
			<ul class="ul-list" id="consequences">
				<li>
					<strong>Corrective Actions:</strong> Frequent absenteeism, tardiness,
					or failure to notify supervisors may result in verbal or written
					warnings, performance reviews, suspension, or, for severe or repeated
					violations, termination.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Escalation:</strong> Continued non-compliance will be
					escalated to the HR department for formal review and action, which may
					include adjustments to shift schedules or changes in responsibilities.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>6. Exemptions and Special Considerations</h3>
			<ul class="ul-list" id="exemptions">
				<li>
					<strong>Emergency Situations:</strong> Recognizing that emergencies
					arise, the policy allows for flexibility in cases of unexpected
					illness, family emergencies, or other unavoidable situations.
					Employees are encouraged to communicate openly with supervisors about
					these circumstances.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Training Program Adjustments:</strong> For trainees from
					Nkangala TVET College, certain academic requirements may occasionally
					conflict with scheduled shifts. Such conflicts should be communicated
					with as much advance notice as possible to allow for scheduling
					adjustments.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<!--Section-Breaker-->
			<div class="section-breaker"></div>

			<h3>Policy Review and Updates</h3>
			<p>
				This policy will be reviewed annually to adapt to any changes in
				operational needs, industry standards, or workforce dynamics. Updates
				will be communicated to all employees and trainees through official
				channels.
			</p>

			<!--Section-Breaker-->
			<div class="section-breaker"></div>

			<h3>Acknowledgment</h3>
			<p>
				All employees and trainees are required to read, understand, and
				acknowledge this policy as a condition of employment or participation in
				the Villa Roma training program.
